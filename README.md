# Sanic MDL Blog
An asynchronous server running the blog template from Material Design Lite. Eventually will have database support to become a 'live' blog template with admin page and everything.


## Installation

`pip install -r requirements.txt`


## Starting Server

```
NOTICE:

While I have gotten this to work on Windows with Sanic 4.1, this will not run on Windows with Sanic 5+, not by choice, but because required packages for Sanic aren't supported on Windows at this time. ```
```

Simple command to start server:
`python3 main.py`

To access server: http://127.0.0.1:8000
