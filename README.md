# Sanic MDL Blog
An [asynchronous](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/748175/asynchronous-vs-synchronous-execution-what-does-it-really-mean) server running the [blog template](https://getmdl.io/templates/blog/) from [Material Design Lite](https://getmdl.io/) . Eventually will have database support to become a 'live' blog template with an [admin dashboard](https://getmdl.io/templates/dashboard/index.html).


## Installation

`pip install -r requirements.txt`


## Starting Server

```
NOTICE:

While I have gotten this to work on Windows with Sanic 4.1, this will not run on Windows with Sanic 5+, not by choice, but because required packages for Sanic aren't supported on Windows at this time.
```

Simple command to start server:
`python3 main.py`

To access server: http://127.0.0.1:8000
